V2.1 -> V2.2{
    
    13 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Added Tier 2 Obsidian Furnace
            ~ Gui name not showing up correctly. (Fixed. Complete Gui renders correctly).
            ~ Shifting clicking fuel into fuel slot didn't work. (Fixed).
            ~ Shift clicking fuel out of fuel slot would first increase the stack to 64 and 
            wouldn't remove the fuel. (Fixed. Fuel now removes itself correctly).
            ~ Cooking progress bars did not run mutually exclusively. (Fixed).
            ~ Both input slots needed to have an item in them to initiate cooking. (Fixed).
            ~ Shift clicking the input slots would simply toggle which input it would go to. (Fixed).
            ~ Cooking would cook two instances of the item. (Fixed).      
    }
    
    14 Aug - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Fixed duplication bug with T2 obsidian furnace
            - Shift clicking second output no longer duplicates the item if an instance does not yet exist in the inventory
        - Found and fixed a problem where shift clicking output 1 would transfer the item into output 2 if the items matched
            - Shift clicking either output now sends the item straight to the player inventory
        - Fixed T2 Obsidian Furnace 2nd input shift clicking problem
            - Changed syntax so that in the grand scheme, the input slots are identified as a group, then the fuel slot, then the outputs
        - Changed the crafting recipe to use two obsidian furnaces, a diamond and obsidian blocks in an effort to improve 
        obtainability of the furnaces. (Much like ore  ratios. Extensive user testing will be needed to improve this further).
    }
	
	15 AUG - Mattkx4{
        - Added Bone Furnace textures
        - Set furnace to only take bones as fuel. Bone is the same efficiency as coal.
    }

            - Created custom flame particles png files.
            - Added carbon copy flame particles adjusting the RGB filter to alter the colour.
        - Changed T2 and T3 furnaces to spawn their custom particles.
        - Removed T2 side and top textures and utlised the original obsidian furnace textures instead.
        - Removed current T2 and T3 obsidian furnace crafting recipes. 
    }
    
    23 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Identified unknown bug with the T2 and T3 Obsidian Furnace guis
            - Appears as though the flame in the gui is rendering more of the texture than it needs to 
        - Added redstone/hopper furnace
            - currently has the same stats as the regular furnace
            - holds five stacks of items for smelting but will only smelt one at a time

    24 AUG - Mattkx4 {
        - Added Diamond Furnace Tier 3
        - Made some good headway on the Tiering Device. Gonna brainstorm ideas in bed tonight.
            - If you have any thoughts with the tiering device tell me.
            - Thinking of making a firework particle affect when you tier a furnace.
            - Thinking of also making just a Tier 2 Device and a Tier 3 Device. Rather than making all the individual Diamond, brick, gold, etc. tiering devices.
    }
    
    25 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Redstone Furnace coding
            - Custom coding takes items from an inventory above the furnace and places them into the furnace

        - Found a fix for transferring the fuel and cook times to the tiered furnace when tiering
            - Applied the fix to all tiered furnaces
        - Removed the code dropping a block of the furnace structure upon tiering
        - Altered tiering device recipes
            - The "tiering wrenches" now have more suitable recipes and use the tier core
            - Tier Core is the same recipe as the tier 2 device used to have
        - Found the problem causing the flame in the gui to render too much
            - When the renderer got the scaled burn time left if had a chance of returning a value too high
            - Created a cap so that the renderer would only render as much flame as there was
            - Applied the fix to all furnace (Except for the FuelLess Furnace)

        - Switched the FuelLess Furnace code to the Netherrack Furnace
        - Deleted FuelLess Furnace
        - Added a Cactus Furnace
            - Has everything a regular cactus does, except it doesn't grow cactus on top of it ;)
            - Gonna have CK fix the textures on it eventually. It's a wee bit bugged out...
    }
    
    13 SEPT - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Fixed the shift clicking problem with the Netherrack Furnace
        - Adjusted Netherrack Furnace Gui to bring the input slot in line with the output slot
            - Looks a tad neater, also fixed the code to register that change
        - Fixed the derpy Cactus Furnace texture
        - Added counter within Cactus Furnace Tile Entity to count 64 cooked items and then dispense a cactus block
        in an odd direction.
        - Changed wacky furnace recipes to what I think is more balanced, let me know what you think. 
        - Altered the anvil furnace
            - Furnace cooks 25% slower
            - Only takes coal or coal blocks for fuel and then they produce diminished burn times
            - Lowered damage fixed by half
    }
    
    13 SEPT - Mattkx4{
        - Messing with the CK mob (finally figured out how to spawn it lol)
            - Fixed movement speed. Now a decent movement and doesn't have that natural circling movement
            - Fixed knockback resistance.
                - CK now actually get's "knocked back". Before you would hit him and he would just not move lol.
            - We really really really need to figure out the rendering stuff.
                - I'm assuming the problem is the overlapping the textures.
            - Made the NetherrackFurnace burn infinitely if it is lit on the top.
    }
    
    14 SEPT - Mattkx4{
        - Looking into making some achievements
            - I've successfully made the achievement, but haven't had any luck adding it to the player.
                - Need to find an "onBlockCraft" event...

            - Small chance to drop a diamond sword
    }
    
    17 SEPT - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Mucked around with the CK mob
            - Got the sword to render
            - CK will attack you with the sword, still attacks mobs by collision, will change that to sword
            - Added full diamond armor, armor buffs apply and armor may drop but it doesn't render
    }
    
    20 SEPT - Mattkx4{
        - Added bonemeal to bone furnace.
        - Messed around with the particles, but made new progress. Imma screw around with it tomorrow
        - Sharpening up on my HTML Skills. 
            - Plan on creating a website for the Mo' Furnaces Mod and I want to make it look... sexy...
    }
    
    21 SEPT- Mattkx4{
        - Particles, Particles, Particles
            - I kind of got the hang of the particle thingy:
                - So when they say "1.0F" they mean 100% or 255 in RGB Code Values. Anyway, that helped out a bunch.
            - Just because of the texture, I wasn't able to successfully make a white-ish flame or a blue-ish flame, so for now, they're stuck with the originals.
            - I'll do some more work on the blue and white textures when I get time.
            - Changed it so Tier 1, 2, 3 and furnaces all have the same flame color.
            - Briefed CK on the Tiering Device and the Tier 3 Device, so those should be done in a day or two.
            - Yeah, still working on my HTML. Website will hopefully be done by the next, or following update.
    }

    22 SEPT - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Added smelting capabilities to CK
            - right click on him with nothing says go away(need to change to a dynamic chatting)
            - right clicking on him with a diamond adds 2 cooking attempts to the counter and notifies player
            - right clicking on him with a cookable item after being primed will cook the entire size of the stack,
            drop no experience, reduce the counter by one and let the player know what occurred.
        - Neatened up the cooking code
        - Partitioned off the chat messages and their references
        - Will work on the area surrounding and cooking every 1 second tomorrow(every 5 seconds would take 5 minutes to cook a stack)
    }
    
    22 SEPT - Mattkx4{
        - Brief work to CK chat. I'll do more stuffs tomrrow. Not a lot of time tonight.
    }
    
    23 SEPT - Mattkx4{
        - Did A LOT of work to the CK chat. It's a little bit more... interesting now. I'll see what I can do with him later (probs not tomorrow (usually busy on wednesday)).
    }
    
    24 SEPT - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Finalised the cooking process for the CK mob. I am now happy with it and will leave that mechanic alone for the time being
        - I also left in the code (commented out) that identifies if the player is within a cube around the mob.
        - Tomorrow I'm going to work on the flame particles again, try out the idea of cloning the default flame and the particles texture,
        changing the ttexture and point the clone flame to the new texture.
    }
    
    25 SEPT - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Finally got the custom particles working.
            - Attempted a second method of spawning custom particles, it didn't work.
            - Added custom tier 2 and tier 3 flames.
            - Added custom texture maps (entire particle texture) for the T2, T3 flames.
            - Changed the flames spawned by the T2, T3 furnaces to their respective flames.
        - As a guide to add in custom particles, you need to clone the T2 or T3 flame FX's, change the resource location
        and create a new resource that is a copy of the original particles texture with the flame particle altered.
    }
    
    25 SEPT - Mattkx4{
        - More particle work.
            - Created a TextureMap named "custom_flames.png"
            - It holds 7 particle textures for the following furnaces
                I. Redstone/Netherrack/Anvil Furnace
                II. Iron/Quartz/Bone Furnace
                III. Gold Furnace
                IV. Obsidian Furnace
                V. Diamond Furnace
                VI. Cactus Furnace
                VII. Brick Furnace
            - If you intened on adding more textures to the map REMEMBER that the counting starts at "0" not "1".
            - Made a bunch of simple one color textures. I'll have CK work on them when he's done with this current assignment.
            - Particles are now DONE (in coding) for this update! Great work!
    }
    
    26 SEPT - Mattkx4{
        - Starting to write wiki stuffs. I'm making a more in-depth description for the previous stuff and creating some new pages.
    }
    
    27 SEPT- Mattkx4{
        - Added Tier3Device and TierCore Textures
        - Briefed CK on particle asignment.
        - Writing more wiki things. All done with the landing-page, installation, and update changelog.
            - I'll write more tonight, but for now, I'm done for the day.

        - Added some more textures in
    }
    
    30 SEPT - Mattkx4{
        - Added CactusFurnace has been added to the custom_furnace.png

    1 OCT - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Added in the update checker
            - My previous commit added in a static file to the git hub repository that stored the most up to date mod version
            and a website where one can download the latest update.
            - This new class compares the static "newest version" to the version of the local mod being used.
            - This function only activates on client loading a world. Testing needs to determine if this extends to 
            the use of portals and dimension crossing.
            - The function will tell the player when there is a new mod version available.
            - If the mod is up to date then the function will tell the player that this is the case.
    }
    
    3 OCT - Mattkx4{
        - I got our first T2 and T3 texture in there! 
            - Thanks CK for amazing IronFurnaceT2/3 Textures!
    }
    
    4 OCT - Mattkx4{
        - Played around with CK chat some more. I think I got it where I want it to be. Extensive testing will let me figure that out.
    }
    
    9 OCT - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Commented out a chunk of code from the RenderEntityCobaltKatana that was preventing a clean build
        - Changed the entity ID so it wouldn't clash
        - Reduced CK mob spawn rate dramatically
        - Fix in netherrack furnace, where the code was trying to reference the incorrect slot
    }
    
    10 OCT - Mattkx4{
        - Small organizational fixes regarding item/block initialization.
        - Began on FurnaceVariables class.
            - Pretty much just a class holding static variables with all the speeds and efficiencies for the furnaces.
            - Need to do the T2 and T3 Furnaces.
    }
    
    27 OCT - Mattkx4{
        - Finished FurnaceVariables
        - Added code to make the Tier2 and Tier3 Devices "disappear" after usage.
            - I think only one use enough. T2 and T3 Furnaces are pretty OP...
        - I'm commanding myself to finish the wiki so we can get this dang release out.
            - I've started now, and the wiki will be done by tomorrow.
    }
    
    28 OCT - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Changed CK spawn rate to 1, hopefully this dramatically reduces the spawnrate in desert biomes.
        - Improved and altered CK's targeting attributes
            - Will now target all mob type entities
            - Possibility to damage any entity upon collision, even if accidental (side effect #1)
            - Will attack other CK entities (side effect #2)
        - Added efficiency description and attributes to the furnace variables
        - Made changes to the damnable Iron Furnace to avoid clashes with other mods
    }
    
    28 OCT - Mattkx4{
        - Changed the Bone Furnace fuels
            - Previously the bonemeal produced 3200 ticks of fuel and bone produced 1600.
            - That doesn't make sense however since 1 bone gives you 3 bonemeal.
            - So I changed it so that one bonemeal produces 1/3 of the amount that a bone produces.
    }
    
    29 Oct - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Made alterations to the code governing item inputs for the redstone furnace. This appears 
        to have fixed the problem without causing additional errors. Testing will reveal any further 
        complications.
    }

ALPHA 0.1 -> V2.1{

	obsidian furnace
		- added inverse fuel efficiency integer
		- fixed furnace not returning to idle bug
		~~unknown bug retaining to smaller valued fuels(stick)
			- testing to see if bug's effects acts on other small items - does not
			- fixed bug retaining to smaller valued fuels(stick) (previous bug)
		/*
		 *inverse fuel efficiency is dependent on furnace speed, 
		 *	- ie. regular furnace has speed of 200 and implied efficiency of 1. 
		 *	obsidian furnace has speed of 50 and inverse efficiency integer value of 4.
		 *	both have the same efficiency to speed ratio of 1:200
		 */		
		- increased obsidian furnace inverse fuel efficiency integer to 8.
			- this decreases the actual fuel efficiency to half that of regular furnace
			- changing the integer to 16 would make the furnace 1/4 as efficient
		~~halving efficiency created a bug in smaller valued fuels(stick) resulting in 4 sticks not smelting 1 item
			- attempted solution resulted in a surprising effect of creating an ever-cooking furnace, 
			will utilize effect for netherrack furnace's ability to not need fuel
		- solved previous bug
			- solution casts the individual calculation parts as doubles, adds 0.5 to round up, 
			then casts result as an integer, in the very long run this may result in an extra smelt from the fuels
			-tested, works

	added new furnace: diamond furnace
		- simple copy and paste of obsidian furnace classes with all references to obsidian furnace  changed to diamond furnace
		- adjusted smelting speed to 3 times a regular furnace
		- increased fuel efficiency of diamond furnace to equal that of a regular furnace
			~~bug created, similar to previous bug, needs trial and error fine tuning of TileEntityDiamondFurnace->updateEntity->burnTime
		- solved previous bug, however induces a rounding error that will stack with excessive amounts of item to be cooked.
		I estimate that cooking three stacks of a single item will result in enough leftover fuel for an extra item to be cooked.
		testing will have to confirm or deny this but it isn't a mod breaking error.		
		 
	changes to the custom furnace gui
		- renamed textures/gui/obsidian_furnace.png to custom_furnace.png 
		- Corrected calls in GUI classes to grab the custom_furnace.png gui
		- altered color hues to look different
		- Changed crafting recipe of Diamond Furnace to use regular diamonds
		
	changed custom textures to the following format:
	  	 <FurnaceType>Furnace_<side>_[active/idle]. Example
	   	- ObsidianFurnace_front_active.png

	7 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
		added new furnace: iron furnace
			- created the iron furnace with 2X furnace speed and 1X fuel efficiency, no problems encountered
			- recipes are exactly the same as the other except it utilizes iron_ingot
			- added new iron furnace textures
			- texture is simply the diamond texture lightened and unsaturated to look like iron
		
		edited en_US.lang
			- added the iron furnace tile entity name
			- added names for the containers:osidianFurnace, diamondFurnace,ironFurnace,Inventory 
			to fix names not rendering in the gui
		neatened up imports in most .java files

		refactored(renamed) the main java file from More Furnace Mod to MoFurnacesMod to keep it in line with mod name

		added textures/gui/custom_gui.png so the graphical user interface now renders properly
	}

	8 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
		added new furnace:gold furnace
			- created the gold furnace with 4x furnace speed and 0.5x fuel efficiency, no problems encountered
			- furnace ignores input items containing the substrings: "ore", "Ore", "_ore", "dust"
			- recipe is the same as iron and diamond furnaces, except uses gold_ingots
			- added new gold furnace textures, will change to a gold brick like texture later to avoid 'boring, constant texture patterns'
			- added new names to en_US.lang
	}
	
	8 AUG - Mattkx4{
	   - Changed new furnace textures (yours are still awesome by the way)
	   - Fixed a bunch of spelling mistakes in the dev log... (Yeah...)
	   - Changed Creative Tab Icon to DiamondFurnaceActive
	   - Corrected hardness and resistance of certain furnaces
	       - Changed Gold Furnace specifically to hardness of 3.0F (That's hardness of Gold Block)
	       - Also changed Iron Furnace Resistance for Idle to 10.0F (Don't know why it was at 50.0F O.o)
	   - Added Brick Furnace with speed of 1.5 and efficiency of 1.5
	       - Needs speed/efficiency correction. (see TODO)
	   - Added Harvest Levels to all furnaces
	       - Harvest levels are all pickaxes
	       - The level is correspondant to the actual block. (Gold block, diamond block, brick block)
	   - Added Quartz Furnace. 
	       - Needs speed/efficiency correction. (see TODO)
	   - Finished adding all new textures
	}

	9 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
		- Fixed brick and quartz furnace speed and efficiency. (Good job by the way, very close to the real numbers).
		- Added the netherrack furnace to specs listed and added effect of not needing fuel.
            - Needs custom textures, current textures are a mishmash of the others.
        - Adjusted step sounds for the quartz and brick furnaces.
        - Fixed name in README.md
	}
	
	9 AUG - Mattkx4{
	   - Edited the Netherrack Furnace a lot today. Ended up making so that it only has 3 fuel...
	       - Fuel are:
	           - Netherrack = 20000 (Equal a to a lava bucket on regular furnace)
	           - Lava Bucket = 40000 (Two times a normal lava bucket)
	           - Blaze Rod = 4800 (Two times a normal blaze rod)
	       - Particles in the Netherrack furnace are always there, along with the active texture!
	   - Added recipes for all the furnaces that allow you to "upgrade" them in the crafting table
	   - Added Bone furnace
	       - Speed of 175
	       - Fuel Efficiency 2
	       - You can input bone as a fuel (it burns just as much coal).
	}
	
	10 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
	   - Netherrack Furnace corrections.
	       - Corrected fuel efficiency value to 1. (1 fuel will last for the stated number of ticks)
	       - Added fuel: Blaze Powder = 2400.
	       - Removed possibility of ANY other fuel being used. (Can still be inserted just not burnt)
	       - Added future code to de-render the fuel slot from the GUI.
       - Hid Bone furnace recipe, will be a creative mode easter egg for a future release. 
       - Polishing up of code.
            - Polished all files in the blocks, handler, lib, main and proxy folders
   }
   
   10 AUG - Mattkx4{
       - Added all the custom GUIs. (Thanks to my good friend CobaltKatana)
       - Refactored GuiHandler.java to MFMGuiHandler.java
       - Refactored FuelHandler.java to MFMFuelHandler.java
       - Polished up the rest of the code (Wow... That TileEntity class was a lot of work...)
   }
   
   11 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Removed unneeded imports from several classes.
        - Recipe changes.
            - Hid the un-tiered crafting recipes for the furnaces.
            - Altered recipes icons to be more unique.
                - Hopefully addresses craft-ability problem.
            - Changed quartz furnace quartz requirement from item to block.
        ~ Gold Furnace smelts metallurgy dusts.
            - Added extra substring to the conditional statement.
            - Gold furnace no longer smelts metallurgy 4 dusts.
        - Adjusted netherrack furnace fuel efficiency to appropriate values.
        - Created checklist to test mod against.
        - Tested a 1.7.2 build of the mod against the checklist utilizing Metallurgy 4 as a baseline
            - Problems with crafting recipes found and corrected.
