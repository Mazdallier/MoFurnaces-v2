Fixed:
    - Gui name not showing up correctly
        - Complete Gui renders correctly
    - Shifting clicking fuel into fuel slot didn't work
        - Fixed
    - Shift clicking fuel out of fuel slot would first increase the stack to 64 and wouldn't remove the fuel
        - Fixed. Fuel now removes itself correctly
    - Cooking progress bars did not run mutually exclusively
        - Fixed
    - Both input slots needed to have an item in them to initiate cooking
        - Fixed
    - Shift clicking the input slots would simply toggle which input it would go to.
    - Cooking would cook two instances of the item 
        - Fixed


ISSUES:
    - Can't shift click into second input slot [3]
    - Shift clicking out of second output slot [4] will double the amount in the output stack
        - NOTE. This doesn't happen if there is an instance of the item already in the inventory
