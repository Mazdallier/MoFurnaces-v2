        - Added hopper code to the redstone furnace tile entity.
            - Code is carbon copied from the hopper tile entity
            - Surprisingly the code sort of works, 
                - Items thrown onto the furnace are deposited in the input slots
                - A chest on top of the furnace will deposit items into the input slots
                - A chest on the front of the furnace will pull items from the input slots
                    - this needs to be redirected to focus on the output slot
                - Hopper code does not differentiate between cookable, non-cookable and fuel items
    }

Notes:
    - The code for the hopper part and the furnace part don't seem to be clashing. Good.
    - Heading to bed soon, this is a sticky note of what I think needs to happen.
    1. There is a piece of code that picks an item stack from a chest or on top of the furnace
        - This code then scans through all of the slots, all of the slots that can have items inputted into them
        - The code then places the item stack and repeats the process until there are no more items in the inventory 
        or on top of the furnace, or until there are no more input slots available.
    ~ This code needs to be first found and then adjusted in two ways
        ~ First the code needs to look only for cooking items and fuels
        ~ Second the code needs to place fuel ONLY in the fuel slot and cooking items into the inputs
    2. There is a piece of code that, if an appropriate inventory is attached to the front of the furnace
        - The code will pull item stacks from the inputs and fuel slots and place them into the chest
        - The code will pull item stacks from the output slot and place them into the chest.
    ~ This code first needs to be found, second the following changes need to be made
        ~ The pulling out of items needs to be restricted to the output slot only
        ~ The side that the adjoining inventory needs to be on should be changed to any of the sides
            ~ The bottom stops the inventory from being opened and the front blocks the view of the furnace state.
