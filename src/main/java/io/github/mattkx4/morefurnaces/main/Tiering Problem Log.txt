Fixed:
    X Gui name not showing up correctly
        - Complete Gui renders correctly
    X Shifting clicking fuel into fuel slot didn't work
    X Shift clicking fuel out of fuel slot would first increase the stack to 64 and wouldn't remove the fuel
    X Cooking progress bars did not run mutually exclusively
    X Both input slots needed to have an item in them to initiate cooking
    X Shift clicking the input slots would simply toggle which input it would go to.
    X Cooking would cook two instances of the item 
    X Shift clicking out of second output slot [4] will double the amount in the output stack.
        - NOTE. This doesn't happen if there is an instance of the item already in the inventory
    X Shift clicking on first output slot while an identical item is in the second output slot will
    transfer the item from the stack in output slot 1 to output slot 2.
        - NOTE. This doesn't work the other way around
    X Can't shift click into second input slot [3]


ISSUES:

    - Bug found with the rendering of the GUI's.
        - This bug appears to render the cooking flame AND the arrow above it for some unknown reason
        - More testing is needed to see if it only effects the bigger fuel items or every fuel item
