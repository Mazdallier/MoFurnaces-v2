0.1 -> 0.2{

	obsidian furnace
		- added inverse fuel efficiency integer
		- fixed furnace not returning to idle bug
		~~unknown bug retaining to smaller valued fuels(stick)
			- testing to see if bug's effects acts on other small items - does not
			- fixed bug retaining to smaller valued fuels(stick) (previous bug)
		/*
		 *inverse fuel efficiency is dependent on furnace speed, 
		 *	- ie. regular furnace has speed of 200 and implied efficiency of 1. 
		 *	obsidian furnace has speed of 50 and inverse efficiency integer value of 4.
		 *	both have the same efficiency to speed ratio of 1:200
		 */		
		- increased obsidian furnace inverse fuel efficiency integer to 8.
			- this decreases the actual fuel efficiency to half that of regular furnace
			- changing the integer to 16 would make the furnace 1/4 as efficient
		~~halving efficiency created a bug in smaller valued fuels(stick) resuting in 4 sticks not smelting 1 item
			- attempted solution resulted in a surprising effect of creating an evercooking furnace, 
			will utilise effect for netherrack furnace's ability to not need fuel
		- solved previous bug
			- solution casts the individual calculation parts as doubles, adds 0.5 to round up, 
			then casts result as an integer, in the very long run this may result in an extra smelt from the fuels
			-tested, works

	added new furnace: diamond furnace
		- simple copy and paste of obsidian furnace classes with all references to obsidian furnace  changed to diamond furnace
		- adjusted smelting speed to 3 times a regular furnace
		- increased fuel efficiency of diamond furnace to equal that of a regular furnace
			~~bug created, similar to previous bug, needs trial and error fine tuning of TileEntityDiamondFurnace->updateEntity->burnTime
		- solved previous bug, however induces a rounding error that will stack with excessive amounts of item to be cooked.
		I estimate that cooking three stacks of a single item will result in enough leftover fuel for an extra item to be cooked.
		testing will have to confirm or deny this but it isn't a mod breaking error.		
		 
	changes to the custom furnace gui
		- renamed textures/gui/obsidian_furnace.png to custom_furnace.png 
		- Corrected calls in Gui classes to grab the custom_furnace.png gui
		- altered colour hues to look different
		- Changed crafting recipe of Diamond Furnace to use regular diamonds
		
	changed custom textures to the following format:
	  	 <FurnaceType>Furnace_<side>_[active/idle]. Example
	   	- ObsidianFurnace_front_active.png

	7 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
		added new furnace: iron furnace
			- created the iron furnace with 2X furnace speed and 1X fuel efficiency, no problems encountered
			- recipes are exactly the same as the other except it utilises iron_ingot
			- added new iron furnace textures
			- texture is simply the diamond texture lightened and unsaturated to look like iron
		
		edited en_US.lang
			- added the iron furnace tile entity name
			- added names for the containers:osidianFurnace, diamondFurnace,ironFurnace,Inventory 
			to fix names not rendering in the gui
		neatened up imports in most .java files

		refactored(renamed) the main java file from More Furnace Mod to MoFurnacesMod to keep it in line with mod name

		added textures/gui/custom_gui.png so the graphical user interface now renders properly
	}

	8 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
		added new furnace:gold furnace
			- created the gold furnace with 4x furnace speed and 0.5x fuel efficiency, no problems encountered
			- furnace ignores input items containing the substrings: "ore", "Ore", "_ore", "dust"
			- recipe is the same as iron and diamond furnaces, except uses gold_ingots
			- added new gold furnace textures, will change to a gold brick like texture later to avoid 'boring, constant texture patterns'
			- added new names to en_US.lang
	}
	
	
	TODO 
		- diamond furnace custom textures - DONE
		- add in remaining furnaces with the following attributes
			- brick furnace: speed = 1.5, efficiency = 1.5
			- iron furnace: speed = 2, efficiency = 1 - DONE WITH TEXTURES
			- quartz furnace: speed = 1, efficiency = 2
			- netherrack furnace: speed = 0.5, efficiency = no fuel needed
			- gold furnace: speed = 4, efficiency = 0.5, added effect of not smelting ores - DONE WITH TEXTURES AND ADDED EFFECT
		- create/find custom textures for previous mentioned custom furnaces

}

Wishlist{

	- fix inevitable problems with netherrack furnace and gold furnace
		- remove netherrack furnace fuel slot
	- multi smelting furnaces, furnaces with will individually smelt more than 1 item
		- tiered to smelt 1, 2, 3 and 4 items simultaneously
		- idea: replace side faces with front faces
	- ender furnaces
	- redesign custom furnace gui
	- implement ability to turn ingots into blocks if enough ingots are available
		- send to a secondary output slot, not the primary output
	- furnace upgrades ??? not likely due to nature of mod being similar to tool tiering
