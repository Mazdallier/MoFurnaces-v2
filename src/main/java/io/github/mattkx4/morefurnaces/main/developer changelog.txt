changelog 

0.1 -> 0.2{

	obsidian furnace
		- added inverse fuel efficiency integer
		- fixed furnace not returning to idle bug
		~~unknown bug retaining to smaller valued fuels(stick)
			- testing to see if bug's effects acts on other small items - does not
			- fixed bug retaining to smaller valued fuels(stick) (previous bug)
		/*
		 *inverse fuel efficiency is dependent on furnace speed, 
		 *	- ie. regular furnace has speed of 200 and implied efficiency of 1. 
		 *	obsidian furnace has speed of 50 and inverse efficiency integer value of 4.
		 *	both have the same efficiency to speed ratio of 1:200
		 */		
		- increased obsidian furnace inverse fuel efficiency integer to 8.
			- this decreases the actual fuel efficiency to half that of regular furnace
			- changing the integer to 16 would make the furnace 1/4 as efficient
		~~halving efficiency created a bug in smaller valued fuels(stick) resulting in 4 sticks not smelting 1 item
			- attempted solution resulted in a surprising effect of creating an ever-cooking furnace, 
			will utilize effect for netherrack furnace's ability to not need fuel
		- solved previous bug
			- solution casts the individual calculation parts as doubles, adds 0.5 to round up, 
			then casts result as an integer, in the very long run this may result in an extra smelt from the fuels
			-tested, works

	added new furnace: diamond furnace
		- simple copy and paste of obsidian furnace classes with all references to obsidian furnace  changed to diamond furnace
		- adjusted smelting speed to 3 times a regular furnace
		- increased fuel efficiency of diamond furnace to equal that of a regular furnace
			~~bug created, similar to previous bug, needs trial and error fine tuning of TileEntityDiamondFurnace->updateEntity->burnTime
		- solved previous bug, however induces a rounding error that will stack with excessive amounts of item to be cooked.
		I estimate that cooking three stacks of a single item will result in enough leftover fuel for an extra item to be cooked.
		testing will have to confirm or deny this but it isn't a mod breaking error.		
		 
	changes to the custom furnace gui
		- renamed textures/gui/obsidian_furnace.png to custom_furnace.png 
		- Corrected calls in GUI classes to grab the custom_furnace.png gui
		- altered color hues to look different
		- Changed crafting recipe of Diamond Furnace to use regular diamonds
		
	changed custom textures to the following format:
	  	 <FurnaceType>Furnace_<side>_[active/idle]. Example
	   	- ObsidianFurnace_front_active.png

	7 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
		added new furnace: iron furnace
			- created the iron furnace with 2X furnace speed and 1X fuel efficiency, no problems encountered
			- recipes are exactly the same as the other except it utilizes iron_ingot
			- added new iron furnace textures
			- texture is simply the diamond texture lightened and unsaturated to look like iron
		
		edited en_US.lang
			- added the iron furnace tile entity name
			- added names for the containers:osidianFurnace, diamondFurnace,ironFurnace,Inventory 
			to fix names not rendering in the gui
		neatened up imports in most .java files

		refactored(renamed) the main java file from More Furnace Mod to MoFurnacesMod to keep it in line with mod name

		added textures/gui/custom_gui.png so the graphical user interface now renders properly
	}

	8 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
		added new furnace:gold furnace
			- created the gold furnace with 4x furnace speed and 0.5x fuel efficiency, no problems encountered
			- furnace ignores input items containing the substrings: "ore", "Ore", "_ore", "dust"
			- recipe is the same as iron and diamond furnaces, except uses gold_ingots
			- added new gold furnace textures, will change to a gold brick like texture later to avoid 'boring, constant texture patterns'
			- added new names to en_US.lang
	}
	
	8 AUG - Mattkx4{
	   - Changed new furnace textures (yours are still awesome by the way)
	   - Fixed a bunch of spelling mistakes in the dev log... (Yeah...)
	   - Changed Creative Tab Icon to DiamondFurnaceActive
	   - Corrected hardness and resistance of certain furnaces
	       - Changed Gold Furnace specifically to hardness of 3.0F (That's hardness of Gold Block)
	       - Also changed Iron Furnace Resistance for Idle to 10.0F (Don't know why it was at 50.0F O.o)
	   - Added Brick Furnace with speed of 1.5 and efficiency of 1.5
	       - Needs speed/efficiency correction. (see TODO)
	   - Added Harvest Levels to all furnaces
	       - Harvest levels are all pickaxes
	       - The level is correspondant to the actual block. (Gold block, diamond block, brick block)
	   - Added Quartz Furnace. 
	       - Needs speed/efficiency correction. (see TODO)
	   - Finished adding all new textures
	}

	9 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
		- Fixed brick and quartz furnace speed and efficiency. (Good job by the way, very close to the real numbers).
		- Added the netherrack furnace to specs listed and added effect of not needing fuel.
            - Needs custom textures, current textures are a mishmash of the others.
        - Adjusted step sounds for the quartz and brick furnaces.
        - Fixed name in README.md
	}
	
	9 AUG - Mattkx4{
	   - Edited the Netherrack Furnace a lot today. Ended up making so that it only has 3 fuel...
	       - Fuel are:
	           - Netherrack = 20000 (Equal a to a lava bucket on regular furnace)
	           - Lava Bucket = 40000 (Two times a normal lava bucket)
	           - Blaze Rod = 4800 (Two times a normal blaze rod)
	       - Particles in the Netherrack furnace are always there, along with the active texture!
	   - Added recipes for all the furnaces that allow you to "upgrade" them in the crafting table
	   - Added Bone furnace
	       - Speed of 175
	       - Fuel Efficiency 2
	       - You can input bone as a fuel (it burns just as much coal).
	}
	
	
	TODO 
		X diamond furnace custom textures 
		X add in remaining furnaces with the following attributes
			X brick furnace: speed = 1.5, efficiency = 1.5
			X iron furnace: speed = 2, efficiency = 1
			X quartz furnace: speed = 1, efficiency = 2
			X netherrack furnace: speed = 0.5, efficiency = no fuel needed
			X gold furnace: speed = 4, efficiency = 0.5, added effect of not smelting ores
		X create/find custom textures for previous mentioned custom furnaces
        X Correct speed for Quartz and Brick Furnace
        X Custom Netherrack Furnace textures
        X Fix Netherrack Furnace to be less buggy
            NOTE: I changed it so it uses only netherrack, lava buckets, and blaze rod as a super efficient fuel.
        - Add an effect so that if you light the Netherrack Furnace on fire, it's infinite fire
        - Custom Bone Furnace textures
        - Custom GUI Textures for ALL FURNACES
        - Compile into .jar and start extensive testing
        - Create posts on MCF and PMC
        - Start next version
}

Wishlist{

	- multi smelting furnaces, furnaces with will individually smelt more than 1 item
		- tiered to smelt 1, 2, 3 and 4 items simultaneously
		- idea: replace side faces with front faces
	- ender furnaces
	- redesign custom furnace gui
	- implement ability to turn ingots into blocks if enough ingots are available
		- send to a secondary output slot, not the primary output
	- furnace upgrades ??? not likely due to nature of mod being similar to tool tiering
    - custom particles
}
