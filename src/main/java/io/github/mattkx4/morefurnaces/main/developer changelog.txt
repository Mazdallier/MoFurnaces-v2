V2.1 -> V2.2{
    
    13 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Added Tier 2 Obsidian Furnace
            ~ Gui name not showing up correctly. (Fixed. Complete Gui renders correctly).
            ~ Shifting clicking fuel into fuel slot didn't work. (Fixed).
            ~ Shift clicking fuel out of fuel slot would first increase the stack to 64 and 
            wouldn't remove the fuel. (Fixed. Fuel now removes itself correctly).
            ~ Cooking progress bars did not run mutually exclusively. (Fixed).
            ~ Both input slots needed to have an item in them to initiate cooking. (Fixed).
            ~ Shift clicking the input slots would simply toggle which input it would go to. (Fixed).
            ~ Cooking would cook two instances of the item. (Fixed).      
    }
    
    14 Aug - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Fixed duplication bug with T2 obsidian furnace
            - Shift clicking second output no longer duplicates the item if an instance does not yet exist in the inventory
        - Found and fixed a problem where shift clicking output 1 would transfer the item into output 2 if the items matched
            - Shift clicking either output now sends the item straight to the player inventory
        - Fixed T2 Obsidian Furnace 2nd input shift clicking problem
            - Changed syntax so that in the grand scheme, the input slots are identified as a group, then the fuel slot, then the outputs
        - Changed the crafting recipe to use two obsidian furnaces, a diamond and obsidian blocks in an effort to improve 
        obtainability of the furnaces. (Much like ore  ratios. Extensive user testing will be needed to improve this further).
    }
	
	15 AUG - Mattkx4{
        - Added Bone Furnace textures
        - Set furnace to only take bones as fuel. Bone is the same efficiency as coal.
    }
    
    22 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Firstly, Merged the zh_CH.lang file created by sb023612.
            - TODO updated to include credit to sb023612 for their contribution.
        - Created a T3 obsidian furnace to be used as a template
            - Same stats at an obsidian furnace but can smelt 3 items at once.
            - Crafting recipe uses 2 diamonds, an obsidian furnace, a T2 obsidian furnace and obsidian
        - Altered T2 and T3 Obsidian furnaces with custom active front textures to help differentiate but only when active.
            - May / May not have all of these tiered textures completely redone by CobaltKatana.
        - Attempted to add custom flame particles for the tiered furnaces(Failure).
            - Created custom flame particles png files.
            - Added carbon copy flame particles adjusting the RGB filter to alter the colour.
        - Changed T2 and T3 furnaces to spawn their custom particles.
        - Removed T2 side and top textures and utlised the original obsidian furnace textures instead.
        - Removed current T2 and T3 obsidian furnace crafting recipes. 
    }
    
    23 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Identified unknown bug with the T2 and T3 Obsidian Furnace guis
            - Appears as though the flame in the gui is rendering more of the texture than it needs to 
        - Added redstone/hopper furnace
            - currently has the same stats as the regular furnace
            - holds five stacks of items for smelting but will only smelt one at a time
            - no other effects yet
       - Added redstone furnace textures
            - Custom redstone gui
            - retextured the diamond textures to look red (hopefully temporary)
    }    
   
    23 AUG - Mattkx4 {
        - Organized the tiered packages a little bit more.
        - Added "Tiered" Creative Tab
        - Told my texture guy to work on the RedstoneFurnace :)
        - Corrected the Redstone Furnace GUI to display the name slightly higher. It was being covered by the slots.
        - Changed name of the tier2/3 gui.png files.
        - Added Diamond Furnace Tier 2 (not enough time in the night to make Tier 3) I'll do it tomorrow.
    }
     
    24 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Reset the Redstone Furnace gui to display the name in previous position
            - Altered the gui png file to move the inputs, fuel and output slots down and centered more 
    }
    
    24 AUG - Mattkx4 {
        - Added Diamond Furnace Tier 3
        - Made some good headway on the Tiering Device. Gonna brainstorm ideas in bed tonight.
            - If you have any thoughts with the tiering device tell me.
            - Thinking of making a firework particle affect when you tier a furnace.
            - Thinking of also making just a Tier 2 Device and a Tier 3 Device. Rather than making all the individual Diamond, brick, gold, etc. tiering devices.
    }
    
    TODO{
        X Fix T2 Obsidian Furnace 2nd input shift clicking problem
            X Cannot shift click into second input

ALPHA 0.1 -> V2.1{

	obsidian furnace
		- added inverse fuel efficiency integer
		- fixed furnace not returning to idle bug
		~~unknown bug retaining to smaller valued fuels(stick)
			- testing to see if bug's effects acts on other small items - does not
			- fixed bug retaining to smaller valued fuels(stick) (previous bug)
		/*
		 *inverse fuel efficiency is dependent on furnace speed, 
		 *	- ie. regular furnace has speed of 200 and implied efficiency of 1. 
		 *	obsidian furnace has speed of 50 and inverse efficiency integer value of 4.
		 *	both have the same efficiency to speed ratio of 1:200
		 */		
		- increased obsidian furnace inverse fuel efficiency integer to 8.
			- this decreases the actual fuel efficiency to half that of regular furnace
			- changing the integer to 16 would make the furnace 1/4 as efficient
		~~halving efficiency created a bug in smaller valued fuels(stick) resulting in 4 sticks not smelting 1 item
			- attempted solution resulted in a surprising effect of creating an ever-cooking furnace, 
			will utilize effect for netherrack furnace's ability to not need fuel
		- solved previous bug
			- solution casts the individual calculation parts as doubles, adds 0.5 to round up, 
			then casts result as an integer, in the very long run this may result in an extra smelt from the fuels
			-tested, works

	added new furnace: diamond furnace
		- simple copy and paste of obsidian furnace classes with all references to obsidian furnace  changed to diamond furnace
		- adjusted smelting speed to 3 times a regular furnace
		- increased fuel efficiency of diamond furnace to equal that of a regular furnace
			~~bug created, similar to previous bug, needs trial and error fine tuning of TileEntityDiamondFurnace->updateEntity->burnTime
		- solved previous bug, however induces a rounding error that will stack with excessive amounts of item to be cooked.
		I estimate that cooking three stacks of a single item will result in enough leftover fuel for an extra item to be cooked.
		testing will have to confirm or deny this but it isn't a mod breaking error.		
		 
	changes to the custom furnace gui
		- renamed textures/gui/obsidian_furnace.png to custom_furnace.png 
		- Corrected calls in GUI classes to grab the custom_furnace.png gui
		- altered color hues to look different
		- Changed crafting recipe of Diamond Furnace to use regular diamonds
		
	changed custom textures to the following format:
	  	 <FurnaceType>Furnace_<side>_[active/idle]. Example
	   	- ObsidianFurnace_front_active.png

	7 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
		added new furnace: iron furnace
			- created the iron furnace with 2X furnace speed and 1X fuel efficiency, no problems encountered
			- recipes are exactly the same as the other except it utilizes iron_ingot
			- added new iron furnace textures
			- texture is simply the diamond texture lightened and unsaturated to look like iron
		
		edited en_US.lang
			- added the iron furnace tile entity name
			- added names for the containers:osidianFurnace, diamondFurnace,ironFurnace,Inventory 
			to fix names not rendering in the gui
		neatened up imports in most .java files

		refactored(renamed) the main java file from More Furnace Mod to MoFurnacesMod to keep it in line with mod name

		added textures/gui/custom_gui.png so the graphical user interface now renders properly
	}

	8 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
		added new furnace:gold furnace
			- created the gold furnace with 4x furnace speed and 0.5x fuel efficiency, no problems encountered
			- furnace ignores input items containing the substrings: "ore", "Ore", "_ore", "dust"
			- recipe is the same as iron and diamond furnaces, except uses gold_ingots
			- added new gold furnace textures, will change to a gold brick like texture later to avoid 'boring, constant texture patterns'
			- added new names to en_US.lang
	}
	
	8 AUG - Mattkx4{
	   - Changed new furnace textures (yours are still awesome by the way)
	   - Fixed a bunch of spelling mistakes in the dev log... (Yeah...)
	   - Changed Creative Tab Icon to DiamondFurnaceActive
	   - Corrected hardness and resistance of certain furnaces
	       - Changed Gold Furnace specifically to hardness of 3.0F (That's hardness of Gold Block)
	       - Also changed Iron Furnace Resistance for Idle to 10.0F (Don't know why it was at 50.0F O.o)
	   - Added Brick Furnace with speed of 1.5 and efficiency of 1.5
	       - Needs speed/efficiency correction. (see TODO)
	   - Added Harvest Levels to all furnaces
	       - Harvest levels are all pickaxes
	       - The level is correspondant to the actual block. (Gold block, diamond block, brick block)
	   - Added Quartz Furnace. 
	       - Needs speed/efficiency correction. (see TODO)
	   - Finished adding all new textures
	}

	9 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
		- Fixed brick and quartz furnace speed and efficiency. (Good job by the way, very close to the real numbers).
		- Added the netherrack furnace to specs listed and added effect of not needing fuel.
            - Needs custom textures, current textures are a mishmash of the others.
        - Adjusted step sounds for the quartz and brick furnaces.
        - Fixed name in README.md
	}
	
	9 AUG - Mattkx4{
	   - Edited the Netherrack Furnace a lot today. Ended up making so that it only has 3 fuel...
	       - Fuel are:
	           - Netherrack = 20000 (Equal a to a lava bucket on regular furnace)
	           - Lava Bucket = 40000 (Two times a normal lava bucket)
	           - Blaze Rod = 4800 (Two times a normal blaze rod)
	       - Particles in the Netherrack furnace are always there, along with the active texture!
	   - Added recipes for all the furnaces that allow you to "upgrade" them in the crafting table
	   - Added Bone furnace
	       - Speed of 175
	       - Fuel Efficiency 2
	       - You can input bone as a fuel (it burns just as much coal).
	}
	
	10 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
	   - Netherrack Furnace corrections.
	       - Corrected fuel efficiency value to 1. (1 fuel will last for the stated number of ticks)
	       - Added fuel: Blaze Powder = 2400.
	       - Removed possibility of ANY other fuel being used. (Can still be inserted just not burnt)
	       - Added future code to de-render the fuel slot from the GUI.
       - Hid Bone furnace recipe, will be a creative mode easter egg for a future release. 
       - Polishing up of code.
            - Polished all files in the blocks, handler, lib, main and proxy folders
   }
   
   10 AUG - Mattkx4{
       - Added all the custom GUIs. (Thanks to my good friend CobaltKatana)
       - Refactored GuiHandler.java to MFMGuiHandler.java
       - Refactored FuelHandler.java to MFMFuelHandler.java
       - Polished up the rest of the code (Wow... That TileEntity class was a lot of work...)
   }
   
   11 AUG - Pr1meSh0ck{
        - Removed unneeded imports from several classes.
        - Recipe changes.
            - Hid the un-tiered crafting recipes for the furnaces.
            - Altered recipes icons to be more unique.

            - Changed quartz furnace quartz requirement from item to block.
        ~ Gold Furnace smelts metallurgy dusts.
            - Added extra substring to the conditional statement.
            - Gold furnace no longer smelts metallurgy 4 dusts.
        - Adjusted netherrack furnace fuel efficiency to appropriate values.
        - Created checklist to test mod against.
        - Tested a 1.7.2 build of the mod against the checklist utilizing Metallurgy 4 as a baseline
            - Problems with crafting recipes found and corrected.
            - Problems with netherrack furnace found and corrected
